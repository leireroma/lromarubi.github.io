By far the most enjoyable aspect of my academic career so far has been teaching. At UC Berkeley I have served as a TA for multiple courses, including ME 100: Electronics for the Internet of Things, ME 104: Engineering Mechanics II, and Introductory Astronomy. I have also volunteered at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL), where I helped engage students and the public with astrophysics and space science. I have found deep fulfillment in teaching Aerospace Engineering and Astrophysics, particularly in working with students who are just beginning to encounter the elegance and excitement of these fields which I so deeply enjoy.
