Hello!  
I am an undergraduate researcher at UC Berkeley’s [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.berkeley.edu/) and NASA’s [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/). I am majoring in Aerospace Engineering and Astrophysics, and I am broadly interested in aerospace structures, metamaterials, and deployable systems. I am excited about the prospect of creating lightweight and adaptive structural architectures that can absorb energy, dampen vibrations, and operate reliably in the extreme environments of aerospace and space exploration.  

As an undergrad at Berkeley, I pursue these interests through my research on tensegrity lattices and metamaterials, combining [finite element modeling](https://www.ansys.com/products/structures/ansys-mechanical) and experimental testing with machine learning–based optimization to identify designs with enhanced energy absorption and stability. At NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I apply these structural concepts to planetary robotics, working on [deployable mechanisms and sampling systems](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions) for the upcoming Endurance rover mission.  

Basically, I am excited about problems having to do with these two (related!) questions: “In what ways can we design aerospace structures that are simultaneously lightweight and resilient?” and *“In what ways can adaptive architectures transform the way we explore space?” For instance, a question I’ve been pursuing is “How can tensegrity lattices, metamaterials, and deployable systems be engineered to absorb energy, dampen vibrations, and perform reliably under the demanding conditions of flight and planetary exploration?”  

I am honored to be supported by the NASA JPL Education Office, as well as by awards including the CITRIS Aviation Prize and the Berkeley Mentorship Cohort Fellowship.  

In my (limited) free time, I enjoy mentoring students in engineering, swimming competitively water polo, and volunteering as a piano teacher.
