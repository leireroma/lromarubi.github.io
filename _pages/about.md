Hello! I am an undergraduate researcher at UC Berkeley's [Department of Mechanical Engineering (Aerospace Engineering)](https://me.berkeley.edu/) and NASA’s [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/). I am interested in **aerospace structures**, **metamaterials**, and **deployable systems**. I am excited about the prospect of creating lightweight, adaptive architectures that absorb energy, dampen vibrations, and operate reliably in extreme aerospace environments. As an undergrad at Berkeley I pursue these interests through the [Major in Aerospace Engineering](https://engineering.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/aerospace-engineering/) studying structures, vibrations, and aerodynamics and through the [Major in Astrophysics](https://astro.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-programs/major-in-astrophysics/) studying celestial mechanics and instrumentation.

Basically, I am excited about problems having to do with these two (related!) questions: ‘In what ways can we design aerospace structures that are simultaneously lightweight and resilient?’ and ‘In what ways can adaptive, deployable architectures transform space exploration?’ For instance, a question I’ve been pursuing is ‘How can **tensegrity lattices**, **pentamode/bow-tie metamaterials**, and **origami-inspired mechanisms** be engineered—via **finite element analysis** and **machine-learning optimization**—to deliver high energy absorption and robust vibration damping under flight and planetary conditions?’

I am honored to be supported by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and the American Astronautical Society (AAS), as well as by UC Berkeley's Aerospace Engineering Program.

In my (limited) free time, I enjoy mentoring students in engineering, swimming competitively, and volunteering as a piano teacher.
